  abstract  = {The Al K- and LII/III-edge XANES of aluminium oxide are interpreted using empirical molecular orbital theory (EHMO) and ab initio self-consistent field real space multiple scattering calculations (FEFF8). Most features in the XANES at the K- and LII/III-edges are interpreted as shape resonances; although some fine structure, visible at both edges, arises from multiple scattering over the medium range (∼15 Å). The change in local symmetry between octahedral and tetrahedral Al explains the observed differences in the electronic structure. First, Al p–d hybridization is allowed only in tetrahedral symmetry, resulting in a lower absorption edge in tetrahedral Al than in the octahedral. Second, only in octahedral Al do the oxygen orbitals near the valence band maximum (the HOMOs) have the right symmetry to mix with the Al p orbitals just above the band gap (the LUMOs). This gives a more screened core hole in the octahedral case. Calculations on distorted octahedral Al sites reveal both p–d and s–d hybridizations; however, the latter is less prominent. The diffuse d orbitals, which hybridize with the p or s orbitals in tetrahedral or distorted octahedral symmetry, are primarily responsible for the fine structure in the near-edge region (0–15 eV) that is determined by medium-range scattering (up to ∼15 Å). The observed difference in the magnitude of this fine structure at the K- and LII/III-edges is caused by the different degrees of d orbital hybridization with the s and p orbitals.},

  abstract  = {High-resolution Al L2,3-edge x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra have been measured in selected materials containing aluminium in 4-, 5- and 6-coordination. A shift of 1.5 eV is observed between the onset of [4]Al and [6]Al L2,3-edge XANES, in agreement with the magnitude of the shift observed at the Al K-edge. The differences in the position and shape of low-energy components of Al L2,3-edge XANES spectra provide a unique fingerprint of the geometry of the Al site and of the nature of Al-O chemical bond. The high resolution allows the calculation of electronic parameters such as the spin-orbit coupling and exchange energy using intermediate coupling theory. The electron-hole exchange energy decreases in tetrahedral as compared to octahedral symmetry, in relation with the increased screening of the core hole in the former. Al L2,3-edge XANES spectra confirm a major structural difference between glassy and crystalline NaAlSi2O6, with Al in 4- and 6-coordination, respectively, Al coordination remaining unchanged in NaAl1−xFexSi2O6 glasses, as Fe is substituted for Al.},

  abstract = {The effect of biomolecules on the mechanisms of the formation and nature of the transformation products of Al (oxy)hydroxides at the atomic and molecular levels and the impact on their nano-scale surface chemistry remain to be uncovered. In this article, the coordination structure of Al in Al (oxy)hydroxides formed under the influence of tannic acid was studied with X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. Al K-edge and L-edge spectra show that as the tannate/Al molar ratio (MR) was increased from 0, 0.001, 0.01 to 0.1, the coordination number of Al changed from the sixfold coordination to mixed six-, five-, and/or fourfold coordination in the structural network of the Al (oxy)hydroxides formed under the increasing perturbation of tannic acid. In O K-edge spectra, the intensity of the peak assigned to the π∗ at 532.1eV increased as the tannate/Al MR increased, with the spectrum of the Al precipitate formed at a tannate/Al MR of 0.1 being almost identical to that of tannic acid. These results indicate that tannate ligands are incorporated into the structural network of short-range ordered Al (oxy)hydroxides to perturb their structural configuration during the formation of Al precipitates under the influence of tannic acid. With increasing tannate/Al MR, the Al (oxy)hydroxides decreased in amount and developed structural defects and the Al-tannate precipitates increased in amount. The decrease in the coordination number of Al in the Al (oxy)hydroxides is attributed to steric and electronic factors which cause the change in Al-O bonding, because Al is complexed with tannate which has different functional groups and is much larger in size compared with OH and H2O ligands. The surface reactivity of a metal-O bond is related to its covalency and coordination geometry. The findings obtained in the present study are, thus, of fundamental significance in understanding the structural and surface chemistry of Al (oxy)hydroxides and their impact on the transformation, transport, and fate of nutrients and pollutions in the environment.},

Oxygen pressure during the growth has a great impact on the Al composition in (AlGa)2O3, which is investigated utilizing X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction measurements. Measured transmittance spectra and responsivity demonstrate that (AlGa)2O3 photodetectors achieve a wider bandgap compared to a Ga2O3 device. An (Al0.12Ga0.88)2O3 device obtains 10 times higher photocurrent Iphoto than a Ga2O3 photodetector. However, as Al composition increases, significant Iphoto degradation is observed in an (Al0.35Ga0.65)2O3 photodetector. Meanwhile, an (Al0.35Ga0.65)2O3 device exhibits the stronger persistent photoconductivity compared to the Ga2O3 control device. Analysis shows that defect states in a bandgap of (AlGa)2O3 might be associated with the performance change in (AlGa)2O3 photodetectors.},

The contraction in lattice parameters and increase in band gap with increasing Al concentration were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively, and are compared with a first-principles density-functional theory calculation. A novel filtering procedure is described to reduce the uncertainty involved in measuring band gap using photoemission, and to remove asymmetry in XPS line shapes caused by differential charging of loose powder. The lattice parameters vary linearly with Al fraction, but exhibit a change in slope at x = 0.5 that is attributed to the difference between aluminum occupying tetrahedral and octahedral sites in the monoclinic lattice. The band gap changes linearly with local stoichiometry, including increasing when aluminum content at the surface is enriched relative to the interior, with a range of over 1.8 eV.},

  abstract  = {Monoclinic gallium oxide thin films were grown on (0001) sapphire at various substrate temperatures ranging from 400 to 1000 °C by pulsed laser deposition using a KrF excimer laser. The structural, optical and compositional properties of the films were analyzed by using x-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, optical transmittance, and Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy. As the substrate temperature was increased to 800 °C, the gallium oxide film possesses single crystalline phase with a preferred growth orientation of (−201) plane and higher crystal quality than those at the other temperatures. Optical transmittance measurements reveal the films grown at 600-1000 °C exhibit a clear absorption edge at the deep ultraviolet region around 250 nm wavelength. Based on the results of Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy, the O/Ga ratio of gallium oxide film increased gradually with increasing substrate temperature. When the substrate temperature was raised to 800-1000 °C, the film composition was close to the formation of Ga2O3, indicating the O vacancies and defects were reduced. Furthermore, the films grown at 600 and 800 °C were chosen to fabricate solar-blind metal-semiconductor-metal photodetectors. At an applied bias of 5 V, the photodetector prepared with 800 °C-grown film has a lower dark current of 1.2 × 10−11 A and a higher responsivity of 0.903 A/W (at a wavelength of 250 nm) than those with 600 °C-grown films. The better device performance is ascribed to the higher crystal quality and fewer O vacancies in the 800 °C-grown film. Moreover, the results indicate the gallium oxide films presented in this study have high potential for deep ultraviolet photodetector applications.},

We also assessed various methods of bandgap measurement for a-SiNx and SiO2 thin dielectric films. It was found that the linear fit method was more reliable than the onset reading method in avoiding the effects of Cerenkov loss and specimen thickness. The bandgap of the SiO2 was estimated to be 8.95eV, and those of a-SiNx with N/Si ratios of 1.46, 1.20 and 0.92 were measured as 5.3, 4.1 and 2.9eV, respectively.

Silicon oxynitride thin films were grown by plasma-nitridation and annealed-nitridation treatment. XPS results show that for the annealed-nitride SiON thin films, Si3N and N?(SiOx)3 states exist at the interface, while for the plasma-nitride SiON thin films, Si3N, N?(SiOx)3 and Si?N?O states exist at the surface with trapped N2 molecules. The band gap for the annealed-nitride SiON thin film is 8.9 eV at the surface but it is reduced to about 8.45 eV at the interface. Meanwhile, the band gap for the plasma-nitride SiON thin film is 7.4 eV. In addition, REELS turns out to be an excellent method to obtain the band gap and electronic structure in oxide thin films.

The method is based on a Monte Carlo simulated annealing loop with an objective function that seeks to perfectly match the maximum number of correlation functions (as opposed to merely minimizing the distance between the SQS correlation and the disordered state correlations for a pre-specified set of correlations). The proposed method optimizes the shape of the supercell jointly with the occupation of the atomic sites, thus ensuring that the configurational space searched is exhaustive and not biased by a pre-specified supercell shape. The method has been implemented in the “mcsqs” code of the Alloy Theoretic Automated Toolkit (ATAT) in the most general framework of multicomponent multisublattice systems and in a way that minimizes the amount of input information the user needs to specify and that allows for efficient parallelization.},

The influence of both experimental and analytical parameters on the final result was studied systematically to define and improve the understanding of the methods. To check the reliability of this technique the interband transition strength determined was compared with results of vacuum ultraviolet spectroscopy. Good agreement was found if sample preparation was taken into account. The preparation of the specimen for the transmission electron microscopy has an effect on the electronic structure. Quantitative analysis of valence electron energy-loss spectroscopy, using the methods presented, is an important and capable method to determine the electronic structure of materials and it has the benefit of high spatial resolution.},

The capabilities of these new instruments are still being explored, and here we study the effect of monochromation on various aspects of EELS analysis in the infrared (<1 eV) regime. We investigate the effect of varying levels of monochromation on energy resolution, zero-loss peak (ZLP) tail reduction, ZLP tail shape, signal-to-noise-ratio, and spatial resolution. From these experiments, the new capabilities of monochromated EELS are shown to be highly promising for the future of localized spectroscopic analysis.},

Especially, attention has been paid to its peculiar ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties which most other two-dimensional (2D) materials do not possess. This paper presents the first measurement of the thickness-dependent band gaps of few-layer α-In2Se3 by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). The band gap increases with decreasing film thickness which varies from 1.44 eV in a 48 nm thick area to 1.64 eV in an 8 nm thick area of the samples. Further, by combining the improved exchange-correlation potential and proper screening of the internal electric field in an advanced 2D electronic structure technique, we have been able to obtain the structural dependence of the band gap within density functional theory up to hundreds of atoms. This is also the first calculation of a similar type for 2D ferroelectric materials. Both experiment and theory suggest that the variation of the band gap of α-In2Se3 fits well with the quantum confinement model for 2D materials.},

However, such properties are strongly dependent on the synthesis. As gate oxides are usually very thin layers (5-50 nm), investigating its properties is not straightforward. Electron energy loss spectroscopy in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM-EELS) methodology is reported in the nm-scale range. Monochromatic 60 keV electron beam is used to obtain the low energy loss spectrum in order to allow an accurate zero loss peak deconvolution and to avoid Cherenkov effect. The low energy loss spectrum is used to extract the bandgap along diamond-alumina interface and to perform Kramers-Kronig analysis to obtain the complex dielectric function of the Al2O3. High resolution electron microscopy (HREM) and STEM-EELS investigations show that the oxide phase of our sample is γ alumina. Its measured bandgap is 6.8 eV and the dielectric functions yield a value of 3 for the high frequency dielectric constant.},

  abstract  = {This work presents a systematic study that evaluates the feasibility and reliability of local band gap measurements of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 thin films by valence electron energy-loss spectroscopy (VEELS). The compositional gradients across the Cu(In,Ga)Se2 layer cause variations in the band gap energy, which are experimentally determined using a monochromated scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM). The results reveal the expected band gap variation across the Cu(In,Ga)Se2 layer and therefore confirm the feasibility of local band gap measurements of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 by VEELS. The precision and accuracy of the results are discussed based on the analysis of individual error sources, which leads to the conclusion that the precision of our measurements is most limited by the acquisition reproducibility, if the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum is high enough. Furthermore, we simulate the impact of radiation losses on the measured band gap value and propose a thickness-dependent correction. In future work, localized band gap variations will be measured on a more localized length scale to investigate, e.g., the influence of chemical inhomogeneities and dopant accumulations at grain boundaries.},

The resulting two dielectric functions were relatively well matched. On the other hand, the refractive index of HfO2 was measured as 2.18 by VEELS analysis and 2.1 by DFT calculation. The electronic structure of HfO2 was revealed by the comparison of the inter-band transition strength, obtained by STEM-VEELS, with the density of states (DOS) calculated by DFT calculation.},

  abstract = {The low loss region of an EEL spectrum (<50eV) contains information about excitations of outer shell electrons and thus the electronic structure of a specimen which determines its optical properties. In this work, dedicated electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) methods for the experimental acquisition and analysis of spectra are described, which give improved information about the electronic structure near the bandgap region at a spatial resolution in the range of nanometers. For this purpose, we made use of a cold field emission scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) equipped with a dedicated EELS system. This device provides a subnanometer electron probe and offers an energy resolution of 0.35eV. Application of suitable deconvolution routines for removal of the zero loss peak extracts information on the bandgap region while the Kramers-Kronig transformation deduces the dielectric properties from the measured energy loss function. These methods have been applied to characterize the optical properties of wide-bandgap materials for the case of III-nitride compounds, which are currently the most promising material for applications on optoelectronic devices working in the blue and ultraviolet spectral range. The obtained results are in excellent agreement with experimental measurements by synchrotron ellipsometry and theoretical studies. The potential of the superior spatial resolution of EELS in a STEM is demonstrated by the analysis of dielectric properties of individual layers of heterostructures and individual defects within wurtzite GaN.},

The paper describes the experimental procedure and discusses the critical aspects of valence electron energy-loss spectroscopy (VEELS) treatment. In particular, the relativistic losses might affect strongly the results, and therefore they have to be subtracted from the spectra prior the analysis. The normalization of the energy-loss function is performed assuming an uniform thickness of the investigated area, which is reasonably fulfilled for carefully prepared FIB samples. This procedure requires the presence of at least one reference material with known dielectric properties to determine the absolute thickness. Examples of measuring the dielectric constant for several materials and structures are presented.},

The zero-loss peaks (ZLPs) of a monochromator and a cold field emission gun are compared in terms of bandgap measurement performance. The intensity of the ZLP tails at the bandgap energy is more important than the full-width at half maximum of the ZLP, and a monochromator is preferable to conventional electron sources. The silicon bandgap of 1.1eV is evaluated from the onset in the EEL spectrum obtained using the monochromator without a numerical procedure. We also show a high-speed instability-correction technique to realize the inherent energy resolution of the monochromator, in which instabilities of less than 335Hz are corrected using 512 EEL spectra obtained with an exposure time of 1.4ms. It will be useful in bandgap measurements and advanced studies for elucidating sub-eV EEL spectra.},

The calculation results show that the incorporation of Al into β-Ga2O3 leads to the tendency of forming O interstitial defects. And the bandgap of AlGa2O3 is 4.975eV, which is a little larger than that of intrinsic β-Ga2O3. When O vacancies exist, a defect energy level is introduced to the forbidden band as a deep donor level, while no defective energy levels occur in the forbidden band with O interstitials. After Al-doped, a slightly blue-shift appears in the intrinsic absorption edge, and an additional absorption peak occurs with O vacancy located in 3.69eV.},

By introducing Ga and O vacancies, the p-type and n-type QTD β-Ga2O3 can be obtained, respectively. The band gap of the system with O vacancy decrease to 0.7 eV due to the occurrence of the band gap states. All the substitutional dopants induce the system act as n-type doping. Cr, Fe, N and Si atoms create flat band states in the vicinity of the Fermi level, which decrease the band gap of the system. More promising n-type doping can be achieved by placing metal atoms on the surface of QTD β-Ga2O3. The decreased band gap of Sn adsorption can efficiently expand the range of the liner optical absorption of QTD β-Ga2O3.},

  abstract = {When slightly oxygen-deficient, β-Ga2O3 is an n -type semiconductor with conduction electrons exhibiting a bistable spin resonance. In this paper, we discuss the relation between the electronic structure of gallium oxide and this peculiar magnetic property. The electron band structure of β-Ga2O3 is computed with the extended Hückel method. The calculations show that the conduction hand has a strong 4s gallium character (≈ 60%), with a quasi-exclusive contribution of the octahedral gallium ions to the band edge. The conduction band also exhibits a quasi-one-dimensional character with bandwidths much larger along the b* axis than along the a* or c* axes. Therefore, conduction electrons are essentially delocalized along the octahedral chains of the structure, whereas the surrounding tetrahedral chains are not occupied. The low-dimensional character of the electronic structure of β-Ga2O3 is confirmed by ESR and ENDOR spectroscopies of Ti3+ ions in substitutional octahedral sites, which provide evidence for predominant Ti-Ga superhyperfine interactions extending as far as the second neighboring Ga in the chain direction. It is also shown that the two conditions necessary for the existence of bistable conduction electron spin resonance, i.e., a strong dynamic nuclear polarization and a narrow ESR line, can be quantitatively accounted for by the important 4s gallium character of the conduction band and by its pronounced anisotropy.},

The crystal structure, surface morphology, and optical properties of β-(AlxGa1−x)2O3 films were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), atomic force microscope (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and transmission spectra. The β-(AlxGa1−x)2O3 films were preferred [01] orientation. The film grown at 1400 °C has narrower full width half maximum (FWHM) than grown at 1450 °C. As the growth temperature increases, the Al group decreases. The Al content of β-(AlxGa1−x)2O3 films grown at 1400 °C and 1450 °C are x = 0.524 and x = 0.489, respectively. The SEM and AFM images showed different growth mode for β-(AlxGa1−x)2O3 films grown at 1400 °C and 1450 °C and their root-mean-square roughness (RMS) values are 5.27 nm and 5.33 nm, respectively. All the prepared β-(AlxGa1−x)2O3 films have high transmittances exceeding 90% in visible region and large optical bandgap above 6 eV. These results indicate that low-pressure reactive vapor deposition technology is a promising growth technology for a high quality β-(AlGa)2O3 films with tunable properties.},

The compositions of the films as determined from energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDX) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results were XAl = 0.57 ± 0.05 and 0.76 ± 0.05 and XIn = 0.12 ± 0.05 and 0.21 ± 0.05. The optical bandgap was found to correspondingly vary between 6.0 ± 0.2 and 3.9 ± 0.1 eV, as a function of composition via XPS and UV-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis). X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy revealed the films to be highly-oriented $$ \left( {\bar{2}01} \right) $$2¯01-epitaxial films with nanocrystalline domains. Schottky- and MSM-based solar-blind UV photodetectors were fabricated on the films and showed responsivities at 20 V varying from > 104 A/W for the Ga2O3 devices, > 103 A/W for the (AlxGa1−x)2O3 devices and > 102 A/W for the (InxGa1−x)2O3 devices. Modest shifts in wavelength selectivity corresponding with the changes in composition/bandgap were also measured. Time response measurements on Schottky and MSM detectors reveal rise and dwell times on the order of a minute, indicating the presence of photoconductive gain. Noise-equivalent powers were in the fW-pW regime with specific detectivities ($$ D^{*} $$D∗) between 1010 and 1012 Jones. Scanning photocurrent maps display large photocurrent generation at the Schottky interface in the case of a β-Ga2O3 Schottky detector, whereas for an β-(InxGa1−x)2O3 MSM detector the photocurrent generation occurs in the device channel and at the Schottky interface.},

An almost uniform dopant distribution with dopant density in the range of 1018 cm−3 was obtained in (Al x Ga1−x )2O3 layers with Al contents, x < 0.60. At x , small Si segregated zones were observed which was attributed to the increased donor-acceptor transition centers or bond length differences in Al-O, Ga-O and Si-O at high Al content. We have demonstrated that for the single phase β-(Al x Ga1−x )2O3 films with Al content of x < 0.30, dopants prefer to occupy on Ga sites while Al site is preferred for high Al content (x > 0.50) (Al x Ga1−x )2O3 layers. It was also observed for Al content, x = 0.30-0.50, no specific cationic site occupancy was observed, Si occupies either Al or Ga sites. This can be attributed to highly inhomogeneous layers within this Al composition range due to which dopant Si atoms are either in the Al-rich or Al-depleted regions.},

This leads to the dilemma, that optical properties from these media cannot be determined correctly using electron energy-loss spectrometry (EELS) if no corrections are applied. In this work we present two ways out of this dilemma: a reduction of the beam energy and the application of an off-line correction. We demonstrate the accuracy of these two methods by using two similar layers of Six:H having slightly different refractive indices and discuss the impact of the normalization parameter during Kramers-Kronig analysis (KKA) on the obtained dielectric properties. We further demonstrate that KKA can be applied without the use of standard specimens, if thickness determination using transmission electron microscopy and EELS is accurate enough.},

  abstract = {Excitons and plasmons are the two most fundamental types of collective electronic excitations occurring in solids. Traditionally, they have been studied separately using bulk techniques that probe their average energetic structure over large spatial regions. However, as the dimensions of materials and devices continue to shrink, it becomes crucial to understand how these excitations depend on local variations in the crystal- and chemical structure on the atomic scale. Here, we use monochromated low-loss scanning-transmission-electron-microscopy electron-energy-loss spectroscopy, providing the best simultaneous energy and spatial resolution achieved to-date to unravel the full set of electronic excitations in few-layer MoS2 nanosheets over a wide energy range. Using first-principles, many-body calculations we confirm the excitonic nature of the peaks at ~ 2 and ~ 3 eV in the experimental electron-energy-loss spectrum and the plasmonic nature of higher energy-loss peaks. We also rationalise the non-trivial dependence of the electron-energy-loss spectrum on beam and sample geometry such as the number of atomic layers and distance to steps and edges. Moreover, we show that the excitonic features are dominated by the long wavelength (q = 0) components of the probing field, while the plasmonic features are sensitive to a much broader range of q-vectors, indicating a qualitative difference in the spatial character of the two types of collective excitations. Our work provides a template protocol for mapping the local nature of electronic excitations that open new possibilities for studying photo-absorption and energy transfer processes on a nanometer scale.},

Analytical expressions are derived for the point spread function (PSF) that describes the radial distribution of this scattering, based on its angular distribution and a dielectric representation of energy loss. We also compute a PSF for energy deposition, which is directly related to the radiolysis damage created by a small-diameter probe. These concepts are used to explain the damage kinetics, measured as a function of probe diameter, in various polymers. We also evaluate a “leapfrog” coarse-scanning procedure as a technique for energy-filtered imaging of a beam-sensitive specimen.},
