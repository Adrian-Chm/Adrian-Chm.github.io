Further, growths of 33% AGO--β-(Al0.33Ga0.67)2O3--and 50% AGO--β-(Al0.5Ga0.5)2O3 or β-AlGaO3--produce polycrystalline single-phase monoclinic material (β-AGO). All three compositions are investigated by x-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, optical absorption, and 27Al nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). By investigating single phase β-AGO over a large range of Al2O3 concentrations (10-50 mol. %), broad trends in the lattice parameter, vibrational modes, optical bandgap, and crystallographic site preference are determined. All lattice parameters show a linear trend with Al incorporation. According to NMR, aluminum incorporates on both crystallographic sites of β-Ga2O3, with a slight preference for the octahedral (GaII) site, which becomes more disordered with increasing Al. Single crystals of 10% AGO were also characterized by x-ray rocking curve, transmission electron microscopy, purity (glow discharge mass spectroscopy and x-ray fluorescence), optical transmission (200 nm-20 μm wavelengths), and resistivity. These measurements suggest that electrical compensation by impurity acceptor doping is not the likely explanation for high resistivity, but rather the shift of a hydrogen level from a shallow donor to a deep acceptor due to Al alloying. Bulk crystals of β-(Al0.1Ga0.9)2O3 have the potential to be ultra-wide bandgap substrates for thin film growth, with a lattice parameter that may even allow higher Al concentration β-Ga2O3 single crystal thin films to be grown.},

  abstract  = {Abstract High quality dielectric-semiconductor interfaces are critical for reliable high-performance transistors. This paper reports the in situ metal?organic chemical vapor deposition of Al2O3 on ?-Ga2O3 as a potentially better alternative to the most commonly used atomic layer deposition (ALD). The growth of Al2O3 is performed in the same reactor as Ga2O3 using trimethylaluminum and O2 as precursors without breaking the vacuum at a growth temperature of 600 °C. The fast and slow near interface traps at the Al2O3/?-Ga2O3 interface are identified and quantified using stressed capacitance?voltage (CV) measurements on metal oxide semiconductor capacitor (MOSCAP) structures. The density of shallow and deep level initially filled traps (Dit) are measured using ultraviolet-assisted CV technique. The average Dit for the MOSCAP is determined to be 6.4 ? 1011 cm?2eV?1. The conduction band offset of the Al2O3/ Ga2O3 interface is also determined from CV measurements and found out to be 1.7 eV which is in close agreement with the existing literature reports of ALD Al2O3/Ga2O3 interface. The current?voltage characteristics are also analyzed and the average breakdown field is extracted to be approximately 5.8 MV cm?1. This in situ Al2O3 dielectric on ?-Ga2O3 with improved dielectric properties can enable Ga2O3-based high-performance devices.},

Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis)-near-infrared absorption measurements and density functional theory calculations are performed to further connect the nanoscale observation to the macroscale properties arising from the atomic structure. The Hf-doped sample was grown from the melt with a nominal Hf concentration of 0.5 at. %. We show that the Hf dopants prefer to occupy octahedral over tetrahedral sites by 0.68 eV and have some resistance to form precipitates due to a repulsive interaction of 0.17 eV between Hf atoms on neighboring sites. Also, the presence of Hf atoms on either tetrahedral or octahedral sites do not significantly affect the crystal structure of β-Ga2O3. Finally, the bandgap values of the Hf doped β-Ga2O3 obtained by electron energy loss spectroscopy and UV-Vis-spectroscopy were Eg = 4.83 ± 0.1 and 4.75 ± 0.02 eV, respectively, similar to the values reported for unintentionally doped β-Ga2O3 crystals. All these results make Hf an excellent dopant candidate for β-Ga2O3.},

With this significant progress, advanced image quantification and analysis are still at the early stages. In this work, we present the complete pathway for the metrology of atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images. This includes (1) tips for acquiring high-quality STEM images; (2) denoising and drift-correction for enhancing measurement accuracy; (3) obtaining initial atomic positions; (4) indexing the atoms based on unit cell vectors; (5) quantifying the atom column positions with either 2D-Gaussian single peak fitting or (6) multi-peak fitting routines for slightly overlapping atomic columns; (7) quantification of lattice distortion/strain within the crystal structures or at the defects/interfaces where the lattice periodicity is disrupted; and (8) some common methods to visualize and present the analysis. Furthermore, a simple self-developed free MATLAB app (EASY-STEM) with a graphical user interface (GUI) will be presented. The GUI can assist in the analysis of STEM images without the need for writing dedicated analysis code or software. The advanced data analysis methods presented here can be applied for the local quantification of defect relaxations, local structural distortions, local phase transformations, and non-centrosymmetry in a wide range of materials.},

Secondary ion mass spectroscopy measurements show that surface segregation is the chief cause of a large FWHM in MOVPE-grown films. The surface segregation coefficient (R) is observed to reduce with reduction in the growth temperature. Films grown at 600 °C show an electron concentration of 9.7 × 1012 cm−2 and a FWHM of 3.2 nm. High resolution scanning/transmission electron microscopy of the epitaxial film did not reveal any observable degradation in the crystal quality of the delta sheet and surrounding regions. Hall measurements of the delta-doped film on the Fe-doped substrate showed a sheet charge density of 6.1 × 1012 cm−2 and a carrier mobility of 83 cm2/V s.

In particular, by enabling the observation of the structure of materials in their application environments, temperature controlled TEM provides unprecedented insights into the link between the properties of materials and their structure in real-world problems, a clear knowledge of which is necessary for rational development of functional materials with new or improved properties. While temperature is the key parameter in such experiments, accessing the precise temperature of the sample at the nanoscale during observations still remains challenging. In the present work, we have applied aluminium plasmon nanothermometry technique that monitors the temperature dependence of the volume plasmon of Al nanospheres using electron energy loss spectroscopy for in situ local temperature determination over MEMS-type microheaters. With access to local temperatures between room temperature to 550 ∘C, we have assessed the spatial and temporal stabilities of these microheaters when they operate at different setpoint temperatures both under vacuum and in the presence of a static H2 gas environment. Temperature comparisons performed under the two environments show discrepancies between local and setpoint temperatures.},

  abstract = {For the production of novel or more efficient catalysts, the link between nanoparticle (NP) structure and catalytic performances need to be understood. Such an understanding requires tools that allow the ?observation? with single-atom sensitivity of the surface of real catalysts in response to reaction conditions. Indeed, when nanocatalysts operate in gas environment and high temperature, they do not remain static but undergo dynamic atomic-scale processes (surface restructuration, oxidation?) which directly influence catalytic properties. In this work, we have studied the thermal stability of Au-Cu nanocatalysts under oxidative and reductive environments and/or at high temperature using environmental aberration corrected TEM (ETEM). Au NPs with controlled sizes, compositions and morphology were synthesized by pulsed laser deposition. Environmental gas TEM of nanocatalysts at the atomic scale was undertaken in an aberration-corrected JEM-ARM200F TEM with in situ gas/temperature conditions achieved by using a MEMS-based nanoreactor (Protochips Inc.) and equipped with a high performance Gatan OneView camera enabling the capture of both high quality images and high-speed videos of in situ events (512 x 512 pixels at 300 fps). Figure 1 compares TEM images of Au NPs (a) at room temperature in vacuum, (b) at 300°C under O2 atmosphere and (c) at 300°C under H2 atmosphere. At room temperature, in vacuum, NPs are stable but once a gas, O2 and/or H2 is injected, coalescence phenomena appear. The coalescence continues at 100°C and 200°C. An additional phenomenon appears at 200°C with O2 that does not with H2: particle faceting. At 300°C, under O2, all particles are well facetted (truncated octahedron). When we cool down the sample with O2, the faceting disappears. Thus, particles size and morphology are clearly dependent on temperature and gas nature with an increase in temperature favoring particle coarsening and exposure to an O2 atmosphere leading to more facetted Au NPs. Figure2 shows TEM images of Au NPs at 300°C (a) which are all facetted at this temperature (truncated octahedron) and at constant temperature of 850 °C at different times (b,c,d). The NPs become more spherical at higher temperature and began to evaporate at 850°C. One can determine the surface energy of the evaporating particles by means of the Kelvin equation2. There is a size dependence of the surface energy of the NPs, indeed, the surface energy increases with the size. For a particle radius greater than 4nm, one cannot apply the Kelvin model. Thereby, in order to understand the underlying mechanism of the behavior of a nanoparticle in this size range, simulations using the tight binding model are in progress. Also, by alloying gold with copper, we are studying the phase reactivity of AuCu nanoparticles as well.},
